  <h1>Introduction to Yet.Project</h1>

  <p>
    Yet.Project is an <strong>AI-native project management platform</strong> built specifically for developers working with AI assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Yet.Project?</h2>

  <p>
    Traditional project management tools weren't designed for AI workflows. When you're working with AI coding assistants, you constantly need to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Copy-paste task details into AI chat windows</li>
    <li>Manually update task status after AI helps you</li>
    <li>Re-explain project context every new session</li>
    <li>Track what AI did vs what you did manually</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Yet.Project solves these problems with native AI integration through the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <h3>MCP Server</h3>
  <p>
    Our MCP server provides 27+ tools that AI assistants can use directly. Claude can create tasks, update progress, search your knowledge base, and manage projects without any copy-paste.
  </p>

  <h3>REST API</h3>
  <p>
    68+ API endpoints give you full programmatic access to everything. Build custom integrations, automation workflows, or connect with other tools.
  </p>

  <h3>CLI Tool</h3>
  <p>
    Manage projects from your terminal without leaving your editor. Perfect for keyboard-driven workflows.
  </p>

  <h3>Knowledge Base</h3>
  <p>
    Store project context, architectural decisions, and coding conventions that AI can access across sessions. Give your AI persistent memory.
  </p>

  <h3>Activity Tracking</h3>
  <p>
    See exactly what AI did vs what humans did. Full audit trail with agent identification for every action.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create a workspace</strong> - Sign up and set up your tenant</li>
    <li><strong>Generate API keys</strong> - Create keys for yourself and AI agents</li>
    <li><strong>Configure MCP</strong> - Add our MCP server to your AI tools</li>
    <li><strong>Start working</strong> - AI can now manage tasks directly</li>
  </ol>
