  <h1>Team & Permissions</h1>

  <p>
    Collaborate with your team by inviting members and managing their access levels.
  </p>

  <h2>Inviting Members</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Team</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Invite Member"</strong></li>
    <li>Enter their email address</li>
    <li>Select a role (Member or Admin)</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Send Invite"</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The invited person will receive an email with a link to join your tenant.
  </p>

  <h2>Roles</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Role</th>
        <th>Capabilities</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Owner</strong></td>
        <td>Full access. Can delete tenant, manage billing, transfer ownership.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Admin</strong></td>
        <td>Manage projects, members, API keys. Cannot delete tenant or manage billing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Member</strong></td>
        <td>Create and manage tasks in assigned projects. Cannot manage team or settings.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Project Access</h2>

  <p>
    By default, all members can access all projects. You can restrict access:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Project Settings → Access</strong></li>
    <li>Toggle <strong>"Restrict Access"</strong></li>
    <li>Add specific members who should have access</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Removing Members</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Team</strong></li>
    <li>Find the member</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>...</strong> menu</li>
    <li>Select <strong>"Remove"</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Removed members immediately lose access. Tasks assigned to them remain but become unassigned.
  </p>

  <h2>Transferring Ownership</h2>

  <p>
    Only the current owner can transfer ownership:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → General</strong></li>
    <li>Scroll to <strong>"Transfer Ownership"</strong></li>
    <li>Select the new owner (must be an Admin)</li>
    <li>Confirm the transfer</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote>
    <p>After transfer, you'll become an Admin. The new owner gains full control including billing.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Plan Limits</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Plan</th>
        <th>Team Members</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Free</td>
        <td>2 members</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pro</td>
        <td>10 included, then $2/member/month</td>
