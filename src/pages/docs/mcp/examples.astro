  <h2>Task Management</h2>

  <h3>Creating a Task</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "Create a task in MYAPP to implement user authentication with JWT"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`I'll create that task for you.

[Uses yet_task_create with:
  projectId: "proj_xxx"
  title: "Implement user authentication with JWT"
  priority: "high"
  labels: ["feature", "auth"]]

✓ Created task MYAPP-47: "Implement user authentication with JWT"
  Priority: High
  Labels: feature, auth`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Updating Task Status</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "Mark MYAPP-47 as in progress"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_task_update with:
  taskId: "MYAPP-47"
  status: "in_progress"]

✓ Updated MYAPP-47 status to "In Progress"`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Finding Tasks</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "What are my high priority tasks?"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_task_list with:
  status: "todo"
  priority: "high"]

Found 3 high-priority tasks:

1. MYAPP-47: Implement user authentication with JWT
2. MYAPP-45: Fix production database timeout
3. MYAPP-42: Add rate limiting to API`}</code></pre>

  <h2>Knowledge Base</h2>

  <h3>Storing Project Context</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "Save to knowledge base: Our API uses REST with JSON. Auth is via Bearer tokens with 24h expiry. Rate limit is 100 req/min."</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_knowledge_set with:
  key: "api/overview"
  content: "Our API uses REST with JSON..."]

✓ Saved to knowledge base with key "api/overview"`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Retrieving Context</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "What's our API authentication approach?"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_knowledge_search with:
  query: "API authentication"]

Based on your knowledge base:

Your API uses Bearer token authentication with 24-hour expiry.
Rate limit is 100 requests per minute.`}</code></pre>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <h3>Getting Project Status</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "Give me an overview of the MYAPP project"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_project_get with projectId]
[Uses yet_task_list with projectId]

MYAPP - My Application

Statistics:
- Total tasks: 47
- Todo: 12
- In Progress: 8
- Done: 27

Recent activity:
- MYAPP-47 created (2 hours ago)
- MYAPP-46 completed (yesterday)
- MYAPP-45 assigned to John (yesterday)`}</code></pre>

  <h2>Daily Workflow</h2>

  <h3>Morning Standup</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "What did I work on yesterday and what's planned for today?"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_activity_list]
[Uses yet_task_list with status: "in_progress"]

Yesterday:
- Completed MYAPP-44: Add email validation
- Started MYAPP-45: Fix database timeout
- Added 3 comments on MYAPP-45

Today (In Progress):
- MYAPP-45: Fix database timeout (High priority)
- MYAPP-46: Update user dashboard

Blocked:
- None currently`}</code></pre>

  <h3>End of Day Update</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "I finished the database timeout fix. Log 3 hours and mark it done."</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_time_log with:
  taskId: "MYAPP-45"
  minutes: 180
  description: "Fixed timeout issue"]

[Uses yet_task_update with:
  taskId: "MYAPP-45"
  status: "done"]

✓ Logged 3 hours on MYAPP-45
✓ Marked MYAPP-45 as Done`}</code></pre>

  <h2>Code Review Context</h2>

  <h3>Understanding a Task Before Review</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> "I'm about to review PR #123 for MYAPP-45. What's the context?"</p>
  <p><strong>Claude:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>{`[Uses yet_task_get with taskId: "MYAPP-45"]
[Uses yet_comment_list with taskId: "MYAPP-45"]
[Uses yet_knowledge_search with query: "database"]

MYAPP-45: Fix production database timeout

Description:
Database queries timing out under load. Need to add
connection pooling and optimize slow queries.

Comments:
- John: "Main issue is the user list query"
- Sarah: "Also check the report generation"

Related knowledge:
- Database uses PostgreSQL 14
- Connection limit is 100
- Current pool size: 10`}</code></pre>

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Be specific</strong> - Include project names and task IDs when possible</li>
    <li><strong>Use knowledge base</strong> - Store context AI should know across sessions</li>
    <li><strong>Keep tasks updated</strong> - Ask AI to update status as you work</li>
    <li><strong>Log time</strong> - Track time for better project insights</li>
  </ul>
